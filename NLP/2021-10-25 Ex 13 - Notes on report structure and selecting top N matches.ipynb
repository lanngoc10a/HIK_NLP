    "## Key points from comments on how to write an analysis report\n",
    "* __Submit in PDF__. PDF gives you control of how the delivered content is displayed to the end user. It is a universally accepted document format where your formatting will not be altered by the reviewer's version of MS Word or equivalent software.\n",
    "* __Structure your report__. For example, given the current assignment with a 4 page max length:\n",
    "    * Introduction: Explain what the report is about - what is the task/analysis conducted in the report, and how is it structured\n",
    "    * Method: Explain how the task is solved, and for this assignment, be specific on coding steps in order to show that you understand why the various preprocessing and processing steps are taken, and how the underlying basic models work. But do not include code snippets in the text; leave it for the appendix and the .py or .ipynb attachment.\n",
    "    * Results and discussion: Present the results, and offer your cognitive judgment on model performance, whether results are reasonable, what matching scores have been accomplished, and offer hypotheses for why the model behaves as it does with the given data. Discuss whether your results or your model is generalizable, and/or for what types of documents or problems it is well suited. Discuss whether other models may have yielded different results on your data, and how - as in \"opportunities for future research\", often seen in academic journal papers.\n",
    "    * Conclusion: Briefly re-iterate what you set out to do (very short, but same meaning as communicated in the Introduction section), how you have done it (very short, but same meaning as communicated in the Method section), and what were the results. Conclude by a very brief note of some of the analysis from the Results and discussion section.\n",
    "    * References\n",
    "* __Be clear and concise__ in your choice of words. \n",
    "    * Use only words and concepts you fully understand, and create efficient, accurate sentences. \n",
    "    * Feel free to mix long and short sentences. Not every sentence has to be as complex as the most advanced NLP model. A concise, to-the-point and accurate language style is more impressive. \n",
    "    * Avoid 'I did...' and other personal nouns. Rather, employ the slightly passive and inpersonal language style of (good) research papers. For example: \"The preprocessing includes tokenization, stopwords and special character removal...\"/\"During preprocessing, the documents are tokenized...\"\n",
    "* __Make sure the report looks good__, typesetting/graphics wise. Take inspiration from (good) research papers in journals, except keep it single column and (for this assignment) skip the abstract.\n",
    "* __Use__ charts and __figures if helpful__ to explain your analysis, underlying model logic et cetera.\n",
    "* __Use references where applicable__. Any accepted academic referencing standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key remarks on the code attachment\n",
    "* __Use comments extensively__. Even on very simple operations. Show us that you understand what's going on in every line of your code. \n",
    "* __Make sure the code attachment is executable__ and bug-free. Delivery as __.ipynb__ or __.py__. "
